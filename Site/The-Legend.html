                            <p>
                                In the beginning there were the Universities. They were old, they were full of old people,
                            and the young programmers suffered there.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Then came the private schools. They taught the young students, for a price. They had to
                            suffer the pain of learning for years, and then years more would they need to offer they
                            lives for the companies. It was better, for there was education, but it was still painful
                            for the young programmers.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Then came a single young student, who was not like the others. He was determined there had to
                            be a better way, and he decided to make it. He was named Nakov, and He was sent to free the
                            young programmers from their suffering, and make them into developers. And so began the
                            Legend of Nakov, and the Creation of all that was good for the young Developers.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            He had a dream. And the biggest part of that dream began when He created the Academy for Ninja
                        Developers. There, he sought to train the young Developers to be more than developers, more than
                        code monkeys. He sought to make them into Ninja Developers, wielding the dark arts of ASP.NET,
                        Javascript, and many, many more. He began implanting his secret techniques in the minds of the
                        young developers, and He saw that it was good.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But many of the young programmers gave up - the training was gruelling, and only a select few
                        could finish it, and become true Ninja Developers. So He took the best of them under his wing,
                        and He made them into Ninja Trainers, capable of passing his techniques and knowledge to the
                        young programmers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But that was still not enough, and so He left his Ninja Academy, and embarked on a journey to
                        seek the proper path in order to create a true place of higher learning, where the young
                        programmers could learn to be true Developers.

                        <p>Nakov had travelled far and wide, and He had created a plan. He banded together with his fellow trainers, young minds sharing His dream, and They created their utopia. It was called GagUni, and it was the place for the young programmers to live, learn, bond, drink and joke all day. It was, and is, the Answer He arrived to after his long years of travel.</p>
                        <p>And then came His disciples, who had taken His ideals to heart, and who wished to further better His dream. </p>
                        <p>And so it began, the Legend of GagUni!</p>
