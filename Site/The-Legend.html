                        <p>In the beginning there were the Universities. They were old, they were full of old people, and the young programmers suffered there.</p>
                        <p>Then came the private schools. They taught the young students, for a price. They had to suffer the pain of learning for years, and then years more would they need to offer they lives for the companies. It was better, for there was education, but it was still painful for the young programmers.</p>
                        <p>Then came a single young student, who was not like the others. He was determined there had to be a better way, and he decided to make it. He was named Nakov, and He was sent to free the young programmers from their suffering, and make them into developers. And so began the Legend of Nakov, and the Creation of all that was good for the young Developers.</p>
